# django_local_library
This project is another progression through the MDN Tutorial suite, this time targeting server-side development with Django. It is a simple catalog manager for a local library that uses many core concepts of Django and server-side development in general, such as 
1. Managing a development server
2. Creating models to represent the catalog
3. Using the Django admin site to fill in the data of the catalog
4. Implementing views to retrieve data in the right format for various requests
5. Creating HTML templates that will be used in combination with the views to serve dynamic HTML
6. Implementing mappers to map different URL patterns to their respective views
7. Implementing user authorization and sessions to effectively manage access and approved behavior
8. Using tests to test the implementation of the development server.
9. And finally, deploying a finished version of this site.
## MDN 
I have done many of MDN's tutorials and can not recommend them enough. I personally found the CSS tutorials extremely useful, and I use them as a reference point anytime I am running into CSS trouble. 
## Additional Resources 
If you are also looking to learn Django or server-side development in general, I would obviously recommend the [MDN Django tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Server-side/Django), but there are also the Django docs, which I've heard are quite extensive, although I haven't used them much yet. The docs contain both guides for [installation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/intro/install/) and also tutorials for getting a basic grasp of [the framework](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/intro/tutorial01/). I have also found a great resource for anything Django called [Awesome Django](https://github.com/wsvincent/awesome-django?tab=readme-ov-file)(maintained by [Will Vincent](https://github.com/wsvincent) and [Jeff Triplett](https://github.com/jefftriplett)), from third-party packages to open source projects and tutorials.
